This is a simple repository for University of Kurdistan's students who attends in Data Structure lesson on 2022's autumn semester professor of the class is Dr Amanj Khoramyan and I'm his assistant

This repository includes some point that you can learn.
 - [BitWise.java](https://github.com/momen7899/DataStructureTA/blob/main/src/com/datastructure/BitWise.java)  is a class that you can see some examples of working with bit operators in java
 - Working with double and float has some problems in java and in [DoubleAndFloatNumbersProblem.java](https://github.com/momen7899/DataStructureTA/blob/main/src/com/datastructure/DoubleAndFloatNumbersProblem.java) you can see them.
 - In [LinkedListExample.java](https://github.com/momen7899/DataStructureTA/blob/main/src/com/datastructure/LinkedListExample.java) we implements linked list with two methods as method that add new object to the end of the list and method b that add new object to the first of the linked list.
 - To solve this [problem](https://quera.ir/problemset/9743/) we use back track algorithm that you can see algorithm [here](https://github.com/momen7899/DataStructureTA/blob/main/src/com/datastructure/Sudoku.java)
 - [stack package](https://github.com/momen7899/DataStructureTA/tree/main/src/com/datastructure/stack) you can find some class that implements stack in java
