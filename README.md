# DataStructureTA
This is a simple repository for University of Kurdistan's students who attends in Data Structure lesson on 2021's autumn semester. Professor of the class is Dr Amanj Khoramyan and I'm his assistant

This repository includes some point that you can learn.
 - [BitWise.java](https://github.com/momen7899/DataStructureTA/blob/main/src/com/datastructure/BitWise.java)  is a class that you can see some examples of working with bit operators in java
 - Working with double and float has some problems in java which you can find them in [DoubleAndFloatNumbersProblem.java](https://github.com/momen7899/DataStructureTA/blob/main/src/com/datastructure/DoubleAndFloatNumbersProblem.java) you can see them.
 - In [LinkedListExample.java](https://github.com/momen7899/DataStructureTA/blob/main/src/com/datastructure/LinkedListExample.java) we implements linked list with two methods:
 Method a , adds new object to the end of the list
 Method b , adds new object to the beginning of the list
- To solve this [problem](https://quera.ir/problemset/9743/) we use back track algorithm that you can see algorithm [here](https://github.com/momen7899/DataStructureTA/blob/main/src/com/datastructure/Sudoku.java)
 - [stack package](https://github.com/momen7899/DataStructureTA/tree/main/src/com/datastructure/stack) you can find some class that implements stack in java
